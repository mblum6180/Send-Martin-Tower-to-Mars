Level two is a flying in-space simulation. It's a timed level with the player object moving at a fixed rate toward the top of the screen. Once they reach the top the level ends. The player must avoid the debris that is randomly generated. If the player hits debris once there is fuel loss and if they hit the same debris again there is even more fuel loss and the debris is destroyed. 
All debris is destroyed once it scrolls off-screen.

Background scales as time goes on to imply the feeling of movement.

Level three is a Lunar Lander style game. The player must land on the surface slowly enough to not crash and onto a level surface to not tip over.

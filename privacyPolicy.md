## Shake Alarm Clock: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Send Martin Tower to Mars! app for Android. This open source app was developed by Matthew Blum in collaboration with Lightly-Salted Production, LLC. You can find the app on Google Play, and its source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

As an avid Android user, I understand the importance of privacy. I want you to know that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Any data you create, such as app preferences or alarms, is stored only on your device and can be easily erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:



| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.VIBRATE` | Required to vibrate the device when alarm is during tower takeoff. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Sincerely,
Matthew Blum
